    Project Goal: I'm using the TMDSCNCD28388D board from TI. I want to measure voltages from an inverter, CAB1000, I will communicate with it using CAN protocol. once I read the voltages I want to send the voltage readings to a laptop using J6 (ethernet) on the DSP board.

    Hardware: What specific microcontroller or development board are you using? TMDSCNCD28388D board from TI

    Problem Description: I'm getting too many problems when I run the code
